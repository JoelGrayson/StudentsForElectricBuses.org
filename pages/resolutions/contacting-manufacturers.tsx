		<p>WHEREAS: buying electric school buses is quite novel</p>
		<p>WHEREAS: there are no examples of private schools buying more than a few electric school buses</p>
		<p>THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: we will have to orchestrate an agreement between manufacturer and Supertrans by ourselves. We will contact a list of manufacturers to get quotes and discuss different pricing options.</p>
