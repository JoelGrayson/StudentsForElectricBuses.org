1
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.080
Joel Grayson: Okay, so

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.149
Joel Grayson: does everyone want to introduce themselves? I'll start. I'm eleventh grader at Riverdale.

3
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.120
Joel Grayson: Really excited about this meeting. I we've been planning for a while now. And

4
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.970
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: why don't you call on people? Joel?

5
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.220
Dan Schultz: Yeah, that makes sense.

6
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.490
Joel Grayson: Hi! My name's Lexia. I'm also in the eleventh grade I Riverdale.

7
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.860
Joel Grayson: I'm Rachel. I'm. Also in eleventh grade. And yeah, i'm excited to be here.

8
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.350
Joel Grayson: Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.400
Talia Proshan: yeah, i'm tall. I go to Fields and i'm also in eleventh grade.

10
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.440
theoaborn: Oh, hi! I'm sto i'm also in eleventh grade, and i'm at a Riverdale.

11
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.220
Joel Grayson: and this is, can so I guess if you want to go.

12
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:15.270
Angela Costanzo: sure i'm Angela Costanzo. I am a sustainability coordinator here at the Hill Campus, and I'm here to support Joel and and the team.

13
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.760
Okay.

14
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.980
Joel Grayson: And who's Mr. Schultz?

15
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.560
Dan Schultz: Dan Shultz. I've been talking to Joel for quite a while. I enjoy my meetings with him in the cafeteria.

16
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.470
Don: I'm glad to be part of this.

17
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.860
Don: I'm sorry, Big deal. I'm I work for Selby Bus. I've been with Sully, for

18
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.260
Don: I think this is my eleventh year. Prior to that I was a consultant.

19
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.870
Don: I've done management consulting for decades. I work for fortune 300 companies at Dp. Level, and

20
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.100
Don: very happy to be in this industry, and i'm actually very excited about electric vehicles so

21
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.190
Don: hopefully. I can add some value to this meeting.

22
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.190
Joel Grayson: Right

23
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:19.560
Joel Grayson: sorry. This is Kelly Alison Flynn, assistant head of School for operations at Riverdale Don. I think we've spoken before, especially during the Covid times, and I think we should just jump right in.

24
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:37.020
Joel Grayson: This is a phenomenon sweeping the nations like your school license is first electric school uses in 1994, but now one of all school buses are electric, which is small, but the new buses that are being bought are increasingly electric. So let's just get started with the presentation. I'm sure you're

25
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.860
Joel Grayson: aware of many of these benefits. But

26
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.040
Joel Grayson: let's just make sure we're on the same page.

27
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.610
Joel Grayson: So

28
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:57.950
Joel Grayson: there are 3 main benefits for electric school buses, which is the environmental. the health and the savings benefits.

29
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.960
Joel Grayson: And Theo. my good friend Theo, we'll we'll start off with the health benefits.

30
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.000
theoaborn: Thanks, Joe and I'll just let you know when to change last.

31
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.710
Joel Grayson: Yeah.

32
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:19.130
theoaborn: Awesome. So obviously all of us here, either being students or being in the business of helping students want to keep children safe. The next slide

33
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.800
theoaborn: Diesel exhaust

34
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:34.080
theoaborn: is very dangerous, and it is releasing chemicals that very negatively affect children. Primarily, children. They affect

35
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:42.860
theoaborn: everybody breathing them in. But because children are so vulnerable as they're developing, it affects them the most next slide.

36
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:54.750
theoaborn: So this is just Alyssa. Some of the chemicals going into the air. Obviously it's also very bad for the environment which we will talk about later, but

37
00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:09.220
theoaborn: directly for what I'm talking about. This is affecting the health of students, of bus drivers and of people who are. Maybe they live next to one of the hill schools, or they live next to one of the routes

38
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.540
theoaborn: that all those people are breathing in these chemicals next slide.

39
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.310
theoaborn: So in like

40
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.390
theoaborn: one side of the spectrum, with the more the most dangerous and the most

41
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:34.160
theoaborn: deadly problems. Studies have shown that, being a bus driver for only 3 months is associated with an increased risk of 6 separate types of cancer

42
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.120
theoaborn: and all types of tumors.

43
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:51.810
theoaborn: Additionally, New Yorkers. So in our city who are living near bus routes. They have an increased rate of emergency calls for respiratory diseases, so that's just going to show how dangerous these fumes are.

44
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.540
theoaborn: Additionally, school buses.

45
00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:07.530
theoaborn: as I said, are producing this Diesel exhaust. And then that goes into the school. As Joel said, we really appreciate you guys making an effort to not be idling outside.

46
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:18.150
theoaborn: because that does help a lot. But at the same time we still do have a fleet of buses coming towards the school, and dropping off these kind of calls which

47
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:29.340
theoaborn: is releasing less chemicals than they would if they were idling. But it's still releasing these chemicals and going into the systems of students. So next slide.

48
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:45.670
theoaborn: So, then, this is also going to be affecting them academically in 2 main ways. So first off studies show that higher pollution is directly related to more missed schools, the more more missed school days.

49
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.370
theoaborn: because students have a weaker lungs, which means that it is far easier for them to get sick

50
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.120
theoaborn: additionally, and in my opinion.

51
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:09.880
theoaborn: very, very scary. The all defined particles in this pollution are able to actually basically go into students brains, and that can be

52
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:24.280
theoaborn: notably lower test scores, because brain development and attention spans are both lowered significantly, and that is obviously very dangerous. And I don't think that anybody really wants that to happen.

53
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.050
theoaborn: Yeah.

54
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:32.900
Joel Grayson: yeah, I just wanted to add, there was a study between in in a school where they took

55
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:43.800
Joel Grayson: normal Diesel vehicles, and then they also retrofitted those vehicles, so they wouldn't emit as much. both inside the bus and outside. And that's where the the

56
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:53.250
Joel Grayson: suppose the conclusion came that test scores are lower when you have more Diesel fume emissions in the school bus.

57
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.110
Joel Grayson: So so that's where the academic part comes in.

58
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.720
Joel Grayson: Sorry continue for you.

59
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.870
theoaborn: Oh, no, that was. That was the part about health.

60
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.650
Joel Grayson: Okay, thank you.

61
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.920
Joel Grayson: Next, Talio will be talking about the environmental benefits.

62
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.170
Talia Proshan: Yes. so environmental benefits of having electrical buses

63
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.160
Talia Proshan: next slide.

64
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:40.310
Talia Proshan: so mainly there wouldn't be the buses wouldn't be emitting dangerous chemicals like Co. 2 and nitrous oxide, and aside from manufacturing, heating, and electricity production. This would really lower the net emissions

65
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:59.690
Talia Proshan: currently in Manhattan, in the Bronx have an f on air quality which is really bad so hopefully this could improve that also. This would save 17 metric tons of Co. 2 each year, which is the same as about 3 New Yorkers. How much they emit annually.

66
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:24.750
Joel Grayson: I think Joel was gonna talk. Yes, so there's also through the vehicle to grid program. Electric school buses stabilize the grid through something called valley filling and peak shading, which essentially means that during the summer, when they're not being used.

67
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:31.770
Joel Grayson: or if they are being used when they're parked, at least they are helping to stabilize the grid.

68
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.250
Joel Grayson: because at high demand for electricity they actually put electricity back into the grid.

69
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:48.690
Joel Grayson: and when electricity is at low demand they take in electricity, this being in the night time, and so the effect is that at

70
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.100
Joel Grayson: peak demand

71
00:08:50.220 --> 00:09:00.700
Joel Grayson: it helps the grid meet that supply or that load, and when when there's not enough, demand it, access that demand. And so the reason this is nice is, first of all.

72
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:14.160
Joel Grayson: you end up actually saving money on the grid and making money for for the electric school bus owner. But also this means that there's less of reliance on fossil fuels during energy peaks, because during these energy peaks.

73
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.030
Joel Grayson: oil and natural gas power plants need to fill in.

74
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:29.330
Joel Grayson: because renewables can't just increase their production. And so, for these reasons validate valid filling and peak shaving would save

75
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.260
Joel Grayson: fossil fuel usage.

76
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:50.070
Talia Proshan: In addition, switching to electrical buses would fulfill 10 out of the 17 UN sustainable development goals, such as good health and well being quality, education, reduce inequalities, decent work and economic growth and more.

77
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.140
Joel Grayson: All right. Now i'm going to talk about economics

78
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.820
Joel Grayson: when purchasing buses directly

79
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:14.260
Joel Grayson: electric school bus costs $370,000 as a up from cost. There are many Federal state and local incentives which decrease this cost, including.

80
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:26.210
Joel Grayson: for example, Volkswagen's Environmental Mitigation Trust, which is a company that actually has to pay money for electric school buses, Nice, cert up from the State

81
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:46.130
Joel Grayson: and the Clean school bus program, which was recently passed by the Biden Administration and dozens of other incentives, which are case by case basis, and grants as well. They're also low interest loans available, such as from the coalition for green capital

82
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.520
Joel Grayson: and other places and

83
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:55.410
Joel Grayson: well, it's a high upfront cost, because operating costs and maintenance costs are lower.

84
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:13.850
Joel Grayson: You can see i'll get back to that side. But in green you have the cost of an electric school bus, and in gray you have the cost of a Diesel bus. You can see the upfront cost is higher, but over time you end up having to pay less for for maintenance and for fuel. And so this means that.

85
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:28.700
Joel Grayson: at least for a line electric bus. This is a quote, by the way, from a few years ago. The return on investment is 9 years now. This doesn't keep in mind the incentives. If there were incentives applied to this, it would be even lower

86
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.720
Joel Grayson: might even be like year 2.

87
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.000
Joel Grayson: And

88
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:53.780
Joel Grayson: that's the basic idea behind the financing. So the operating costs. You could see the fuel here for a Diesel bus. Last time I checked it'd be around 14 cents per mile with the gas surges, though it could be even higher, as we saw recently in current events and

89
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.130
Joel Grayson: for electric buses it is, it is lower.

90
00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.630
Joel Grayson: It is a lower cost to go per mile when running on electricity than in gasoline or Diesel.

91
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:12.180
Joel Grayson: Same thing with maintenance, because electric school buses have fewer moving parts. They don't need to be repaired as often, so it's it's cheaper for maintenance

92
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:20.630
Joel Grayson: and another way to get electric school buses in is, instead of buying them directly

93
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:27.930
Joel Grayson: you can, instead subscribe to a service which will provide them for you.

94
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:38.220
Joel Grayson: An example is Highland Fleet subscription program, where there would be no upfront costs. But you would simply pay $20,000 per year to have the buses

95
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:47.050
Joel Grayson: and Highland Fleet subscription would sort of take out the risk from everything, so it would cover the maintenance and complexity. If

96
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:53.180
Joel Grayson: there's installation that needs to happen, it would also cover that. And there are other developers that do this.

97
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.390
Joel Grayson: such as Lev. Mobility, e. Trans energy and amplitude.

98
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.630
Joel Grayson: So this is better for

99
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.120
Joel Grayson: getting rid of that upfront cost.

100
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:13.720
Joel Grayson: There's also charging infrastructure which would need to be installed. It could be level, one level, 2 DC. Charging.

101
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:24.410
Joel Grayson: It seems to me, from the research. I did that level. One would make the most sense, because it's the cheapest. And by charge you buses overnight we wouldn't need to

102
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:42.270
Joel Grayson: have the fastest available charger, you know just we need to have charger that could do the job overnight, and that's what level one can do. And you know there are more details about this. I could let you know if you wanted, and also through the vehicle to brid program offered by Con Edison. You would end up

103
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:48.160
Joel Grayson: saving money for Con Edison and and their agreements that could be made

104
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:54.170
Joel Grayson: to capitalize off of the fact that the bus could use as a battery when it's not being used to stabilize the grid.

105
00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:00.600
Joel Grayson: for Tara knew if Abd and other companies our providers of charging infrastructure.

106
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:15.770
Dan Schultz: Joe, what would how much time would it take for a bus to charge overnight? Would it be 2 h, 3 h? Would it take a full 8 and just i'm just curious. Is that so? It depends what charging we have Level One is the slowest level, 2 faster, and DC. Is like

107
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:24.740
Joel Grayson: super fast, but this is increasing in in price as well. So, for level one it is.

108
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.900
Joel Grayson: I have

109
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.040
Joel Grayson: talk about

110
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.580
Joel Grayson: charging.

111
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.170
Joel Grayson: If I can find it.

112
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.990
Joel Grayson: I believe

113
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.500
Joel Grayson: Don't quote me. Let me just find it.

114
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:56.930
Joel Grayson: You could. If it's just a swig, you know it's it's fine. Yes, 5 miles of range per hour for a level One charger, because it's a 120 volts a/C level. 2 chargers is 25 miles of range per hour.

115
00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:01.640
Joel Grayson: and DC is like in 1 h you can get the whole thing. So.

116
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:10.990
Joel Grayson: So yeah, if it's charging overnight level, one would make sense. But again it I don't know what roots we're gonna take. But if you want a longer group, then maybe level 2. So

117
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.640
Dan Schultz: yeah, Gotcha. Thank you.

118
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.420
Joel Grayson: Yeah.

119
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:26.490
Joel Grayson: Okay. Moving on to manufacturers. So one of the nice things about electric school buses is that it's the exact same bus model as you could see here with Bluebird.

120
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:46.650
Joel Grayson: It's just a different engine, so it's the same bus just instead of a Diesel gas combustion engine. It's it's an electric engine, and this means it could be the exact same model, same size, same specifications for everything. And so the manufacturers for that are Thomas Bill Buses buying Electric Blue Bird, and I saw

121
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:56.300
Joel Grayson: for super service models that that I was looking at. I believe they have the exact same model that that super self is already using just with an electric engine instead.

122
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.770
Joel Grayson: And now for good publicity.

123
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.840
Joel Grayson: it's just a bonus.

124
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:17.120
Joel Grayson: which is that this is still quite a new area. So if we were to do this, we'd be pioneers, and it it would be furthering the mission of the hill schools, which is to be called innovators and and responsive to climate change.

125
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:24.560
Joel Grayson: and also public schools of the New York State are transitioning to 100% electric by 2,035.

126
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:30.000
Joel Grayson: They're already working on their transition. They've fought a lot of electric but school buses, and

127
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.920
Joel Grayson: it would be nice to not be behind public schools.

128
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.170
Joel Grayson: All right. That's it for the presentation.

129
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.290
Joel Grayson: Now

130
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:54.800
Joel Grayson: I was thinking, we have a discussion. I I want to hear your thoughts. I could also bring up a case study at White Plains. If you want white planes. Did a school bus transition in 2,018, and

131
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.150
Joel Grayson: let me just put the case. Study

132
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:10.319
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: the chats. One question before we talk about white planes. What's the length of service of a bus, whether a Diesel bus or an electric bus.

133
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:15.109
Joel Grayson: So they're both 12 year. They have a 12 year lifespan.

134
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.859
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: That's what you that's your

135
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.430
Don: yeah, I mean, I would say, 12 is probably

136
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.980
Don: the end, you know

137
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.530
Don: it could go further. The those Diesel buses can last for 50 years.

138
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:36.780
Don: We wouldn't use them at our Cs for that that timeframe. Trust me, I think our oldest bus in our Cs is 9 years old.

139
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:37.650
Joel Grayson: Okay.

140
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.660
Don: so. But again we we do like, for since you know.

141
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:53.090
Don: we're retiring probably 4 buses this year. and you know it's funny, because, regardless of what our strategy is. you can't make a purpose right now without thinking

142
00:17:53.180 --> 00:18:01.010
Don: about Ev. Right. So as of 2027. You can't even purchase Diesel anymore, and you want

143
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:12.740
Don: so for us you know we we talk quite a bit. We we work. We buy a lot of equipment off one of those manufacturers that you probably screen Joel and

144
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:17.850
Don: and you know, yeah, so that you know there the advice from them is.

145
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:24.770
Don: Let's make a decision on what to buy. As we approach 2,027 I mean I think the big thing for them is

146
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.870
Don: what's the technology gonna look like in 5 years, right?

147
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:43.910
Don: What's top technology gonna look like by 2,027 we don't know. You know, the again. The media fact we work with is not sure that all of New York City and all of New York State can all go electric at the same time

148
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:54.610
Don: like what's what's the what's the instruction look like. and what's the impact to the grid. because not everything is going to be peak and valley right? So it's just going to be drawing from the grid.

149
00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:03.140
Don: So I get it for us, you know. I mean, since we made is is built on what's gonna happen? Electronic vehicles are inevitable, right?

150
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:11.840
Don: So it's just just question how you transition and Joe like your presentation. How fast do we transition that? Rcs

151
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.350
Don: and that's the 1 billiondollar question, Like if we if we do by

152
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.680
Don: 2 vehicles this year, for example, we're probably gonna get vehicles that are.

153
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:27.800
Don: you know, 4 or 5 years old that we know we're gonna retire them, you know, with 8 or 9 years when we have to.

154
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:40.700
Don: So yeah, it's an interesting, you know, conversation, but every every decision we make has to be based on the future electronic vehicles. We even looked at more property to purchase.

155
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:48.920
Don: to part our vehicles, and you can make those decisions anymore. You just can't buy an empty parking lot anymore, right?

156
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.970
Don: You have to buy a lot that can.

157
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:57.070
Don: You can already envision that you're gonna use it for Ev in 2 3 years down the road.

158
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:58.470
Don: So

159
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:05.240
Don: so yes, definitely. Some we think about. I think our limitation. It's super savvy.

160
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.300
Don: and therefore our Cs for span fields then

161
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:21.840
Don: is, you know we're just, we of not being able to get the grants right. So when you, when you hear about Federal law, you know from infrastructure. You know the big bills that are coming out of the Us. Government.

162
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:28.920
Don: They disseminate that money through local school districts. It's like a white plains. Joel, we're really

163
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:37.940
Don: we're at this advantage versus white planes, because white planes is getting a lot of this money. You know whether it's their pilot that they did 18,

164
00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:42.100
Don: or even the future, where they gonna get a lot of these billions from

165
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.270
Don: from Joe biden, you know. So again.

166
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:52.240
Don: you know for us we we have applied, you know, all's not lost all those not lost being a private bus fleet.

167
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.750
Don: We do qualify for the the nice sort of grants.

168
00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:09.130
Don: So we've already applied for those, and we already have access to those as well as the Volkswagen decision. So the money is there, but it just comes down to basic math. Unfortunately.

169
00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.280
Don: like you know you, you're pricing. The bus is that 307,000.

170
00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:37.070
Don: Well, they're over 400 now. So but there's no question. In in fact, the school buses are bad. It's. You know the vans that we use. Joel. it's actually on like 5 x. We can get those vans for about 65,000 if they're gas powered versus 250,000. If they're electronic vehicles you're talking about. The

171
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.860
Dan Schultz: Those are the many events like the 25 passenger

172
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:50.020
Don: all the lower school bands at Rcs and horseman and fields. And they actually use the nice Mix Lower school

173
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.920
Don: and middle of the school or so. That's where it's actually a little bit more.

174
00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:04.770
Don: The math doesn't quite add up. There's no no doubt that the maintenance is much cheaper, Dan. It's like maintaining a gold card.

175
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:13.210
Don: It's i'm not saying I could do it, but it's it's much simpler than a gas powered engine or Diesel powered in.

176
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.720
Joel Grayson: I see. So

177
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.580
Joel Grayson: are you saying you would be easier to transition with the smaller

178
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:33.470
Don: like type a buses.

179
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.590
Don: you know, full size bus. We actually try to avoid Diesel even in our full size buses.

180
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.410
Joel Grayson: Hmm.

181
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:46.170
Don: So just because it's a little bit less expensive, and it's more. It's easier to work on than a Diesel bus.

182
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:55.040
Don: But yeah, the theans unfortunately, the bad cost again you can get a van for about 60 65,000.

183
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.810
Don: I mean those vans that we use. They just really.

184
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:14.840
Don: They're pick up trucks with styrofoam. I'm a you know it just just built up the back, but it's really just a forward f 350. Pick up truck or a chevy silverado. I've already inexpensive to utilize the purchase.

185
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.020
Don: But the electron, the technology for Ev would make it like 5 X.

186
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.950
Don: So it doesn't even that does that up as well as the big bus screen

187
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.330
Joel Grayson: got it.

188
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:45.250
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: So one thing I'm hearing from Don is that the public private divide is part of the obstacle here, so that feels like a an action item for the students here. So you know who who do we need to write to? How do we? How do we work on that? To support decision making

189
00:23:45.250 --> 00:24:06.770
Don: a another question I have is I I hadn't heard about the the sort of like lease rental, you know the Highland Fleet subscription, so that Excuse me, subscription program done how it I mean, do you know much about that? And how does that? So you know it's, you know. Actually, it's funny because policing leasing vehicles is something we've talked about for a long time.

190
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.390
Don: you know. I mean, you know, if if

191
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:24.620
Don: let's say we, we partner with the school like the municipality that we'll actually purchase the vehicles and lease them to us. I mean, that's a viable option. you know, if it's gonna cost us the purchase price.

192
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:35.840
Don: you know. I guess you just really have to do the math, you know, if the least price 30,000 a year. That's essentially all the operating margin we have on the route.

193
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:44.590
Don: you know, versus financing a bus that. And years later we'll, you know we tend to. We tend to finance a bus over 3 years.

194
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:52.050
Don: So by year, 4 by year, 5, my year 6. We don't have those in direct costs related to ownership.

195
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.860
Don: I mean it's a. It's a capital purchase, so we we look at for over 5 years. But

196
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:07.530
Don: so it's it's a lot of math involved, and it's good at some point. It's going to add up Kelly. It's it's inevitable. The math is going to be there.

197
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:17.210
Don: You see the price of electronic vehicles come down. We're hopeful. But yeah, you're right, you know. Can we really compete against white planes.

198
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:23.400
Don: you know? Probably not. Now, Don't. I mean, how many more vehicles have? They added in 2,018, you know.

199
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.650
Don: Yeah, we started off with like 4 or 5 or something small, right?

200
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:42.760
Joel Grayson: You know. They sent us this information. I don't have anything besides that. But but they did do a pilot program starting in 2,018 and

201
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:48.720
Joel Grayson: and yes, it is a public school, and i'm. Curious what the divide is, but but

202
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:55.090
Don: this is also in the agenda I sent you. It's talks about how their transition was

203
00:25:55.230 --> 00:26:09.240
Joel Grayson: a lot of specifics about vehicle to grid program. They did it with line electric, and they were able to set up a a deal with move and and vehicle to grid and excuse me with Con Edison as well to

204
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:16.650
Joel Grayson: get incentives that way, too, and they they They made money savings from the vehicle to grid, and

205
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.350
Joel Grayson: seems like their transition went pretty smoothly.

206
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.590
Joel Grayson: and it worked. That was the main thing, because they were one of the first people to do it. And then it was these questions.

207
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.510
Don: You'll find a lot of case studies out there, I mean.

208
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:42.340
Don: I'm from Massachusetts right. My brother lives in in Beverly, Massachusetts, which is just north of Boston on the coast. and they're They're slowly going to electronic vehicles as well.

209
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.910
Don: but literally it's like 7 of their 48 vehicles are now electronic.

210
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:52.700
Don: They have 4 more next year. So it's something that i'm not saying it's not worth doing right. But

211
00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.760
Don: you know you see a lot of

212
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.300
Don: you know tabs, even private

213
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:07.010
Don: contractors, that sort of get their toll on the water. They'll buy a handful of electronic vehicles. And and you're right. It's great publicity when you do it.

214
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:18.590
Don: You know what one of our friendly of what the you know, the companies that we're friendly with Logan, if you've heard of Logan Bus company. So if you're in New York City you don't log in.

215
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.140
Don: Logan went on. Bought like a half dozen of them.

216
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.990
Don: Yeah, when they got them on the road. They have the mayor show up, you know. Local councilman.

217
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:32.500
Don: the Borough Presidents, You know anyone that was important.

218
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:41.030
Joel Grayson: I I didn't get that invite. So so. But yeah, so we'll get there too. But we so a lot of it now is just sort of there.

219
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.970
Don: you know. They're trying to show that They're moving the right direction by buying a handful

220
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:54.010
Don: so. But it's it's inevitable. It's something we're going to talk about. How quickly can we get there and we do qualify for the nice start, or

221
00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:04.170
Don: 120,000 per bus. So it does make the equation much better. Right? You're looking at a full size bus a $100,000,

222
00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:15.970
Don: and but it's off set by 120 K. And then you do the incremental math over the span. The life life, you know, lifespan of the vehicle. And hopefully you get, you know, most some of that back, right?

223
00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.930
Joel Grayson: Yeah, do you qualify for the clean school bus program or

224
00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:30.820
Don: Yeah. So that's so far, we've only been able to qualify through through the that. The why sort of we were able to. We were eligible for the Volkswagen settlement money.

225
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.850
Don: So but we haven't honestly we haven't purchased

226
00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.330
Don: a new bus since the summer of 2,000, and 18.

227
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:50.920
Don: So our super selby. Probably most of that super sell the appliance super Trans. We applied super trans in 2,021.

228
00:28:51.370 --> 00:29:03.700
Don: And we took all their When we bought some trends, we' all their equipment. So for first time this year we're looking at purchasing to do full-size buses. Well, I say new to us.

229
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.970
Don: what they'll likely be, you know

230
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:14.410
Don: it'll be late model year, but probably like, think like 2020, 2,019, just because we want to phase about what we have to.

231
00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:22.890
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: What what do you think are the cases that you'll one of those 2 could be

232
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.440
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: an electric vehicle

233
00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:31.870
Don: again. It really depends on you know. I mean this, I guess Probably the biggest factor for us is the technology, right? So

234
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:42.960
Don: you know, they have some hybrid buses, or I don't know if Joe, if you ever explored the hybrid option where it's it's it's electric and fuel, so like the Fta buses.

235
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.120
Don: those work great. But that's kind of a technology sort of moving away from hybrid.

236
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:57.110
Don: So I mean, our limitation is that our dealer, our broker, our our major bus vendors, telling us

237
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:02.110
Don: that maybe we'd get 70 miles on a charge a day.

238
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:14.350
Don: That's not bad, but that's for us. That's we, it not. We're we're averaging more than 70 miles a day. So again, not not a big, not a deal. Break it either right because we could do the am. Run.

239
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.570
Don: bring the bus back to the base. recharge it to get ready for the Pm. On.

240
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.340
Joel Grayson: Yeah, actually, what is your average traveling

241
00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:30.260
Joel Grayson: distance for? We actually put that 77 miles a day.

242
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.050
Joel Grayson: So I know that

243
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:39.770
Joel Grayson: there are different. Like battery sizes you can get for electric school buses. There should be like a tier above that. Certainly.

244
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:45.550
Don: Now some of our late buses like this. If you anyone has ever taken late bus service.

245
00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.100
Don: those buses do considerably more.

246
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.270
Don: They'll do an ambro, a Pm. Row, and then a late bus round.

247
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.080
Don: and you're probably looking at over a 100 K: there.

248
00:30:55.490 --> 00:31:01.720
Don: So it's very doable. It's just a concern of ours. We're we're hoping that technology evolves.

249
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.160
Joel Grayson: Yeah, yeah.

250
00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:10.030
Joel Grayson: So is that a limitation? Are there shorter routes that could be done?

251
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:20.820
Don: They would say, I hope so. But that'd be great. Yeah, we're all gonna bring you guys down to like 40 s Street.

252
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:33.520
Joel Grayson: No more New Jersey, No one more Brooklyn.

253
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:40.770
Don: Yeah, I mean, that's very possible. That that is certainly a way to go. The other thing that would upset our culture is that

254
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:45.000
Don: our drivers don't generally return to the base after the am.

255
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:50.870
Don: and we encourage them to take the mus home somewhere near campus, but don't bring it back

256
00:31:50.990 --> 00:32:00.000
Don: to our big buses. Product right way on the east side of the Bronx in Tell a base section of the Bronx, which is right just south of

257
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.900
Don: just south of Co-OP City.

258
00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:08.230
Don: So a lot of the guys will just keep the bus in between the rocks. But the other limitation is there.

259
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:19.840
Don: There's no electricity at that location, and there's no chance of getting electricity. So we are actually looking for another space that we'd like to potentially get for the summer.

260
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:25.650
Don: which will allow us to have a bit more infrastructure than what we currently have.

261
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:59.210
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: So I I'm. I'm not discouraged like it sounds like Don is like we're like getting closer, right like it feels like the the cost. Prohibition is going down a little bit, and your motivation is going up a little bit like you're. You know they're they're coming together, and the question is, what's the differential between those 2 things which you know? There, you don't have to answer at the moment the question that I have, you know. Maybe this is, for Dan is is there.

262
00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:09.290
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: you know, with the school ever like? If we get close with the school, ever be able to contribute to this effort? Or is it just? We're different institutions, and can't do that.

263
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:24.460
Dan Schultz: I don't. I don't know I don't really know the answer to that, like I actually felt like funding, having a having a an ownership piece, or listen I anything anything's possible, and and and it can be could be discussed. I mean it will be, it will be a new

264
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:31.130
Dan Schultz: will be a new avenue that we would be traveling down in terms of an an ownership percentage, or whatever it might be

265
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:48.640
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: just trying to cause, like you know, students, I think you hear from Don. He's like bottom line, bottom line, bottom line, and like he has to be that way, because he's the business guy right? And you know he wants to do the right thing for students and for the earth.

266
00:33:48.640 --> 00:34:04.030
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: and at the same time. You know the dollars are the dollars. And so, you know, just throwing ideas out there. There are 3 schools that use these roots, you know. Could could, you know? Is it? We each contribute a little bit to push you the edge for one

267
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:20.150
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: for one bus, or is it? We each push a little bit, so we can get 3 buses or something like that, you know, recognizing we are also a business, and have to pay attention to the bottom line right? And so you know the world, Hasn't yet caught up with what the you know. We're not charging

268
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:32.330
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: for what things really cost. You know there are costs to the environment and to human health that are not being factored in on a dollar amount. And so we're, we're trying to say. Can can we bring those things together so

269
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:43.750
Don: well? You know, Kelly, one thing one thing to consider, and you know glad dance on the call, You know we get to a point. Let's say it's 2026, and we really want to invest heavily.

270
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:50.530
Don: and in the the fleet for our Cs right minimally. Those 60 big bus rocks. We do. Let's make those

271
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.120
Don: ev vehicles.

272
00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:57.280
Don: you know. We probably go back to Dan again. We're gonna make a major investment for our Cs.

273
00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:11.590
Don: you know. Would you be wanting to extend the contract that you currently have with us through? So it's a 10 year period, then, that then you could. Now now you look at the bath, or you know I'm. I'm, i'm a i'm a sorry Dan, for 10 years.

274
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:18.780
Don: That's a little bit easier. The math lines up. You know much better. You know. The risk we have is let's say.

275
00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:25.020
Don: you know we buy all this equipment, and think of you know 425,000

276
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:38.780
Don: times, you know, 16 buses. And then Dan turns around next week. So you know what Don Yeah. Service that where needs to be is our 60 day notice. We're gonna put you out to bid for 2223

277
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.380
Don: You know what I mean

278
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:47.450
Don: that's where? So again it all depends on you know what we think. We have long term relationships with all our most important partners.

279
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:51.050
Don: and maybe we can. Maybe the math can line up Kelly at some point.

280
00:35:51.220 --> 00:36:01.600
Dan Schultz: Well, we currently have. We currently have a pretty sizable, long-term contract with you guys, my friend. So 8 years left yeah. All 8 years. 8 years, my my friend. So

281
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:06.540
Don: i'm just going through in my head. I'm like, When did we sign with you guys?

282
00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:11.960
Don: Yeah, no, so it's it's it's it's not. It's the equations getting better every day.

283
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.240
Don: There's no question about it.

284
00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:24.360
Joel Grayson: Why, I think we're all trying to make this work. So what incentives do we not qualify for, because we're not a public school district.

285
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:42.680
Don: So again, it's not that it's nothing that's existing necessarily, Joel, but, like that infrastructure bill. That just went through this to set it Biden signed into law if they do, and when they end up distributing their billions of dollars for the electronic bus piece, it's likely going to go through the municipalities

286
00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:46.700
Don: so they'll give the the school districts the money to to be up

287
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:51.820
Don: same way. They handle that you may recall them the way they handle Covid money, too.

288
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:59.740
Don: while the Covid money came from the the Federal Government and the school systems. which still didn't necessarily help.

289
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.720
Don: You know, private contractors.

290
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.800
Don: If that makes sense, so they would probably do the same thing. They would send the money out.

291
00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:17.680
Don: So the districts and the districts, who either on the buses do their own fleets. or they have the additional monies to pay the contract. The private

292
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.760
Don: you guys don't have that luxury

293
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.460
Joel Grayson: got it. I mean. Is there any way we could help you with that like

294
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:31.800
Don: I? I do think I think there is an opportunity that they you know we can explore. You know how we can ensure that

295
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:37.810
Don: these monies can be applied for and received the same similar way we're able to apply

296
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:39.550
Don: through nice sort of right.

297
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:48.830
Don: So if there's a mechanism in which you know these these monies become available, they'll become available in in grant form, probably from the Us. Government.

298
00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.410
Don: and that money can somehow go directly to private contractors.

299
00:37:53.450 --> 00:38:08.050
Don: instead of having to be filed through each city each each time when it's funneled through it. It. Private comp companies Aren't. A priority. Is that right?

300
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:18.530
Don: Like a town that is probably like my, for instance. probably 20% of school funding comes from the city of Mount Burden.

301
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:28.800
Don: The other 80% comes from the State in Federal. I mean, Dan, You know, Kelly, how much money goes to Rcs from the State and Federal Government 0%.

302
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:43.960
Dan Schultz: No? Well, we get, we, we get, we get credit. We do a thing with the State, where, because we we we show proof that we take attendance and things like that. We get some funding from the State every year, but it's it, but it's not. It's not. It's it's nothing. You know. It's it's

303
00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.080
Dan Schultz: it's not it's not very significant.

304
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:51.310
Don: So again, Joe, i'm not saying we won't get money. I'm, i'm hopeful we will

305
00:38:51.420 --> 00:39:02.230
Don: So so again I I think we got to see how it plays out. Yeah, and you know what I can do for you guys. I could actually go back to. So we actually have a consultant

306
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:15.770
Don: with our with our bus manufacturer that can break this all. You know what he anticipates in terms of grants and funding. So right now we're limited to that sort of but doesn't mean that more money is not coming.

307
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.330
Joel Grayson: Got it.

308
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:30.830
Don: But again i'll tell you our manufacturers. Not He's not optimistic that you know. Once everybody goes electric that the grid can handle it.

309
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:38.120
Joel Grayson: That makes sense. Yeah, well isn't it being charged, though at night. So

310
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.410
Joel Grayson: the demand is super low. Then

311
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:46.690
Don: yeah, ideally, I mean again, I think we need to see you know what kind of a draw that, but it has. I mean.

312
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:53.420
Don: you know. I guess, that you can to. People will be running the air conditioning at night right? So I I guess we'd have to see

313
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:57.490
Dan Schultz: I mean well infrastructure the of the grid. I I I mean

314
00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:05.210
Dan Schultz: you're reading all the time about. you know, Con Edison, and the fact that they really Haven't, just using Khan as an example. But they really haven't

315
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:12.340
Dan Schultz: they haven't really kept up with their infrastructure. They haven't really kept up with that technology. They haven't they haven't put money into

316
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:29.950
Dan Schultz: areas where they should be putting things into, and it's a constant balance of, you know, taking you know powering down or taking power from certain area to to to to make sure that their demand stays where it needs to be in other areas, you know. So it it seems like they're in the summertime. They're they're always

317
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.540
Dan Schultz: They're always balancing, so a big part

318
00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.350
Dan Schultz: should you know a big part should be, you know, should be playing with them as well.

319
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:42.790
Dan Schultz: because they're gonna, you know. Ultimately it needs to be supported right. It's not. It's. You know. It's something that we're moving forward with

320
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:50.860
Dan Schultz: It' be interesting to see what they would they have to say. You know it'll be interesting to see if they have a plan, or

321
00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.700
Dan Schultz: or if they have

322
00:40:52.990 --> 00:41:04.330
Joel Grayson: something in place that they're thinking about, Joel, I don't know if that's something you guys might have touched on, and you discussions and all the whole work you guys have been doing. But it's a great program. Yeah, with Con Edison.

323
00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.250
Dan Schultz: Okay.

324
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:14.520
Joel Grayson: where the buses would actually help the grid because it balance the the demand and the load throughout the

325
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:24.690
Dan Schultz: well. My, my follow up on that would be, though. Have we asked, have we asked, what what Con Edison would be doing in terms of their own infrastructure.

326
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:37.190
Dan Schultz: Right as demand is demand decreases, and it sounds great that the charging will be happening at night. But what about the overall demand for electricity as a whole? Are they? Do They have plans to.

327
00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.660
Dan Schultz: you know. make improvements

328
00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:48.690
Dan Schultz: Well, I don't think they'll run out of electricity. No, no, I'm I'm saying it. But the the the the structure in terms of of being able to manage it.

329
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.120
Dan Schultz: That's what i'm talking about

330
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.530
Joel Grayson: the the charging infrastructure

331
00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:00.320
Don: a lot of times. It's actually kind of interesting when we so when we, the

332
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.830
Don: if you're a home or a property owner.

333
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:09.110
Don: If you need your electric upgraded or you don't have enough power, you need more support.

334
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.770
Don: Yeah, you can call the Electric company, and

335
00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:17.710
Don: eventually, you know, weeks or a month or 2 later they'll finally come out and do the upgrade.

336
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:24.550
Don: The the the that we want is when everyone has to do this by 2,027 right? Can they do it?

337
00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:29.360
Don: And that's where we're hearing a lot of skepticism from the the that

338
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:37.580
Don: no one thinks the States can be ready for 2027 if all the all the new vehicles have to be

339
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:54.670
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: school buses, why, is that and well, it can just for one other thing in there, the you know, running out of electricity. Hopefully, we won't do that, but they do shift power around, and so we get that you guys wouldn't know this because you're not on campus in the summer. We get shut down in the summer.

340
00:42:54.670 --> 00:43:08.190
Dan Schultz: They say he goes home at 12, or you Don't, get okay, because they're like it's not critical.

341
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.070
Dan Schultz: you know, the night before. Say, like, you know, there's going to be.

342
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.520
Dan Schultz: you know, a a Major, you know

343
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.770
Dan Schultz: Power need, and you know we need you guys to

344
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:21.060
Dan Schultz: jump off, and and you know we would send folks home to work at home or whatever. But

345
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:24.710
Dan Schultz: I mean, I think that happens all the time. That's why I was talking about that whole balancing thing.

346
00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:33.010
Don: Yeah. yeah, no. Listen. I we're we're optimistic and like, I said, it's not whether you're pessimistic or optimistic. It's. It's where we're heading.

347
00:43:34.080 --> 00:44:04.080
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: And it also just seems like a step wise yeah, introduction of the Evs is the way to go. You start with one, you know, and maybe it's you buy one. But the other thing is, maybe you least one, and see how it goes in terms of your. You know how many miles you can manage, or something like that, like, you know. Recognizing the pace of change of the technology, you know. So that that doesn't mean. You know, students in the room don't that doesn't mean we're slowing down. That's like what we want is a

348
00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:11.780
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: effective. reasonably cost-effective introduction. Right?

349
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:16.530
Don: We talked to the the evp of business at Logan.

350
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.720
Don: And you know they again. They dip their toe on the water last year

351
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:28.020
Don: and and bought some ev vehicles. But even, you know, talking to the Vp. Of business over there.

352
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:40.700
Don: I mean, if the if the technology really changed the next 3 or 5 years. those vehicles might already become dated. and that's the other risk. You run it. We jump in too quick.

353
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:51.000
Don: It's. It's probably gonna hurt us. Not help us. The electric vehicles you mean that you'd buy now would become outdated in fear. So you know how the technology is gonna evolve?

354
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:54.700
Joel Grayson: That's interesting, because they have been

355
00:44:54.850 --> 00:45:09.960
Don: running electric vehicles since 1,994. And well, the Mta. B. Has been going for decades, right? So yeah, I'm not. This is again. I'm just telling you some of the concerns. I mean, you'll hear a lot of wild concerns i'll. I'll give you another one.

356
00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:21.240
Don: You know what happens if that driver doesn't properly fuel up in between the routes. and he or she's heading down the West Side highway

357
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:27.790
Don: and hits traffic or all the George Washington Bridge, and comes to a stop. and then the charge dies.

358
00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:34.570
Don: You know. Now you can argue that could happen with any vehicle. Right? That's the thing that makes us nervous is that

359
00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.160
Don: if it's not intricate, that we're having to fuel up.

360
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:49.630
Don: you know overnight, which is, of course, perfect science. But then, if we have to fuel up every day in between the routes, and if something's best, it's gonna cause the disruption.

361
00:45:50.930 --> 00:46:03.490
Joel Grayson: So I actually spoke with a manufacturer at Line Electric, and they and and looking at the website now they do have a range for 100 to 125 miles

362
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.480
Joel Grayson: per charge.

363
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.470
Joel Grayson: So

364
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:14.090
Joel Grayson: again, if we were to do this with, you know, small tests for you know the smallest route that we're doing.

365
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.370
Joel Grayson: It seems to me like we wouldn't need to charge in between

366
00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.540
Joel Grayson: with a

367
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:34.370
Joel Grayson: below 77 miles per day routes. Yeah, the a. In the West Side rocks are probably your shorter roads right down the highway. I probably stay away from anything downtown and East Side, but certainly the west side buses.

368
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.120
Don: Yeah. yeah.

369
00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.460
Joel Grayson: So

370
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:42.210
Joel Grayson: you said that super salv is looking to buy a bus

371
00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:46.220
Joel Grayson: 2 buses soon. What does it look like with

372
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:54.830
Don: buying new infrastructure? I know buses last for 12 years old, he said. We we, we we we anticipate again. Not at some point.

373
00:46:55.490 --> 00:47:05.910
Don: you know. If we buy brand new right, we we expect to utilize for for 12 years. I mean still very doable right, because 2,035 is the current mandate

374
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:15.340
Don: all AV fleets, so it's still doable. But I almost kind of feel like we're going to be in a different world in 3 or 4 years

375
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:26.160
Don: that have. Then having a new Diesel bus is not going to be in it an attractive option for us. So yeah, our our perspective is let's go get it used one now.

376
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.480
Don: And

377
00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:38.440
Don: what's that? Use the electric vehicle. Although an electric, we we would look for gas gas fuel not Diesel, we try to get gas.

378
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.310
Joel Grayson: And sorry, I guess. Yeah, just for some specific numbers.

379
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:54.360
Don: How many buses do you have? And how often do you expect to replace them? And and

380
00:47:54.890 --> 00:48:07.860
Don: those are the ones that you target for? Obviously the Diesel emissions, right? We probably we're gonna have start phasing in new ones and retiring older ones. I would say I would think 3 to 4 a year.

381
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.240
Joel Grayson: Okay.

382
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:15.010
Don: So we're actually going to retire at least 2 2,012 this year.

383
00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.790
Don: And again they're not bad. We we, when I say, retire, we're going to sell them.

384
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:26.410
Don: We're just not going to use our our private clients just to all for our

385
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.620
the clients.

386
00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:32.290
Joel Grayson: And when you're buying the new buses. I know Ken F brought the separate.

387
00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.130
Joel Grayson: Could you foresee

388
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:44.610
Joel Grayson: buying some Diesel and trying out an electric one? I mean, that's sort of the conversations we we've been having with our manufacturer

389
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:52.380
Don: is, if we did want to go electrical what it looks like. And again, you know, it's through the dealership through the manufacturer.

390
00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:56.480
Don: who, you know they're great at itemizing all the grants and loans you can get.

391
00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:01.300
Don: So that's why we've already applied for some of the stuff that we know we're all.

392
00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:11.990
Don: But again, just like, say, like, Kelly said, it goes down to the math, I mean. Yes, we can save 120,000 through nice sort of right for one purchase.

393
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:20.210
Don: But you're still paying for 20. So then you're paying 3 grand for that. That that point of paying 2 X

394
00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:24.920
Don: for the vehicle, if you just plot it, you know, say 100. 2,000. 530,000

395
00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:28.780
Don: But again like you said, then you do the math over 10 years

396
00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:33.890
Don: cheaper to own, and the fuel economy is better.

397
00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:34.910
Joel Grayson: Hmm.

398
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:43.840
Don: Like length of our contract, like I I don't know that makes me feel really optimistic. We might be able to like

399
00:49:44.000 --> 00:50:00.780
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: agree, you know, to try one. You know the I don't. I don't know if there's a way to I don't know. Push this forward to like. Take one step, you know I we're trying to make sure that we hear bottom line, but also.

400
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:01.900
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: you know.

401
00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:08.620
Don: Push for it, Kelly. Sorry it's not. I don't. I don't think we'd be having this conversation. It wasn't possible

402
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:19.160
Don: so so I I think we gotta get there. and if that means we can, you know, take one small step now. It's not the end of the world. you know.

403
00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:22.430
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: when's the time frame to make those decisions?

404
00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:34.220
Don: Oh, again, I think we would do it locked up with our media factor. I still don't think we. I think we've only scratched the service in terms of what the the Federal Government is going to provide

405
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:43.810
Don: the State governments, so I think we got to see more and more of it. And I think you know, I guess the laws we keep a Democrat in office.

406
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:58.240
Don: you know. So so hopefully, like, I said hopefully. We'll get more money there, and it'll be. you know again. You know. I just My big fear is that you don't want a business model in which all the families that are Cs.

407
00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:10.850
Don: I'm gonna have to pay for a bunch of boss. You know what I mean. That's what you know. That's you know we're trying to protect families from having to invest too much money into daily transportation.

408
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:25.840
Joel Grayson: although if i'm correct because of the return on investment of 9 years with no incentives. And then that $110,000 from Nicerda that would make the return on investment much quicker, so that factor into the

409
00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:33.230
Don: that doesn't line up really in our area, Joel, but it can. You also get a factor in finance fees for

410
00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:34.660
Don: the purchase.

411
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:38.520
Don: which again, like you said. There are just kind of rates out there right that you can get

412
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:43.790
Don: through, you know, through grass and walls. so it's not impossible. But the numbers

413
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:47.560
Don: we were going to do a case Study on what the numbers that up?

414
00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.390
Don: I don't think we're quite there yet.

415
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.240
Joel Grayson: Hmm.

416
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:57.440
Don: Forget about the infrastructure challenges. Right? What is does the math? Is it? Is it less expensive to do, Ev.

417
00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:03.700
Don: then? Few than gas fuel or Diesel right now? No. so make much more sense.

418
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:12.660
Don: you know. Morally, yes, environmentally. Yes, those are all. Yes, there's no question about it. Are we headed there? Yes.

419
00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:16.030
Don: you know. So again it's it's where we're going on.

420
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:18.940
Don: So the economics don't line up today.

421
00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:23.610
Joel Grayson: So what if the next 2 buses we're going to buy this year?

422
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:34.250
Joel Grayson: One of them were electric, and somehow the Hill schools could organize to divvy up that additional premium that goes into buying an electric bus among the 3 schools.

423
00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:42.190
Joel Grayson: And then, when you'd have those operational

424
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:48.230
Joel Grayson: when those operational costs, like fuel and maintenance.

425
00:52:48.410 --> 00:53:01.110
Don: end up saving you money. Then, somehow that money could come back.

426
00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:06.290
Don: the infrastructure cost, and then the the other side. Ledger says what you're saving.

427
00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:10.910
Don: You come to. What is that Delta? And then you would just go ahead and

428
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:16.760
Don: and say this, the search argument so we could just it's just a math problem, Joan.

429
00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:20.400
Joel Grayson: by doing it with only like.

430
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:28.960
Joel Grayson: maybe half or through the buses that we're doing like every third bus is an electric that we're going to buy. Then that that surcharge could also be smaller.

431
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:41.020
Don: Do you do you think that could be possible to. You know one of our, you know our biggest clients like ours, you know. You probably have 8 or 900 families.

432
00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:51.570
Don: you know, participate in the transportation program. So yeah, I mean, it is very possible to say, okay. you know, maybe there's 2 rates. It's the rate. If we do know we need next year.

433
00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:54.620
Don: and this is the rate of if we can add 2 buses to the police.

434
00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:02.270
Don: I mean I i'm

435
00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:07.770
Dan Schultz: it it's a it's a process of discussion. But I mean, we've already talked about setting our rates for this year.

436
00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:15.870
Dan Schultz: Oh, yeah, yeah, You know what i'm saying. So Our rates are set for going into the contractual 2324 school year. So those are already set

437
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:23.020
Don: right. No, no, just over time there that you know, again. you know, if we do purchase the 2 vehicles we purchase, or

438
00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.280
Don: we intend to put it. How Hebrew.

439
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:29.160
Don: which one of our clients we don't have any older.

440
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:32.280
Don: The bus fleet at our Cs is a little bit newer than

441
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:39.930
Don: some are smaller clients. But again, anything's possible to all. So it's. So the buses are actually separate. They're not shared like

442
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.230
Joel Grayson: fleets for every separate school.

443
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:47.030
Don: What does our smaller accounts tend to get the older bosses.

444
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:51.580
Don: Our larger, more valued clients get the newer losses.

445
00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:56.400
Don: So. So we are. Fees go well, I mean, I guess it. It can work

446
00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:03.390
Don: if we phase out to how Hebrew vehicles. I could probably pull 2 older Rcs vehicles and use them there.

447
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:04.740
Don: So anything's pause.

448
00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:05.880
Joel Grayson: Hmm.

449
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:26.090
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: So what I I i'm just noticing it's 50'clock, and I know Mr. Shalt has to go, and I have to go as well, Don. I wonder if you could when you when you're you. I know you work with the consultant, you know, and they're giving you the prices and trying to figure out what the incentives are. Would you be willing to come back to us when that decision making time is.

450
00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:30.580
Don: Yeah, Kelly, you do the words right on my mouth. What I can do is I can set up a meeting.

451
00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:35.720
Don: I just do a dinner meeting or lunch meeting with the with the manufacturer and the consult.

452
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:53.760
Don: and i'll just say to them, You know, guys, just what would it look like if we wanted to do this, how could we? What's the best way to make it happen now? Of course they're all saying, don't do it yet. That's but but there is a May all right. I understand what you're saying. It does make sense.

453
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:58.310
Don: you know, from a you know. economical standpoint today.

454
00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:09.910
Don: But if we really want to do it. Maybe it's not purchasing buses this year, but next year. you know, we'll be on the contract for next year with an Ev bus, you know. What would that look like? What would that cost?

455
00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:14.280
Don: And then it comes down to okay. It's gonna cost X amount of dollars.

456
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:18.780
Don: and you know. Maybe if it's negligible, it's something we can, you know. Talk about

457
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:24.430
Don: passing on to our clients in school year 2424, 25

458
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:48.310
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: that that that makes sense to me to, you know, like when you're at the moment of like having clear sense of what the costs are, and you know we you can think about it from your end. We can do our math and see if we can convince you the you know that the you know, despite the differential now. The cost savings would be, you know, in X number of years, and and.

459
00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:54.630
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: you know, have a Have repeat this conversation then. So do you know when that would be the timeframe.

460
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:59.840
Don: I could have a a meeting with them this week. It's really it's.

461
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.540
Don: you know we've we've we've got. We have a relationship with the manufacturers. We've

462
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:12.080
Don: you know we have multiple properties, right? So our other company we have 550 vehicles with. So we're

463
00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:21.120
Don: quite often buying bands with with these guys. So we're we're a pretty important client to them. so I could. I could arrange for meeting in pretty short order.

464
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:25.180
Kelley (she/her) Nicholson-Flynn: Okay, and then you want to get back to us, or how do you want to handle that?

465
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:43.090
Don: Yeah, if you want? In fact, you want to put a meeting on the calendar for a couple of weeks. That's more than enough time if that helps you guys. Yeah, let's do it. First week of April for folks at Riverdale, I. This week, and next week I think, are not good. So yeah, actually make it the second week, April, because the first week, April i'm away.

466
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:48.770
Joel Grayson: Okay, Second week of April.

467
00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:56.750
Don: So we'll we'll, you know. I'll have the manufacturer. The consultant tells us about. You know the viability of buying when we should buy.

468
00:57:56.810 --> 00:58:00.750
Don: what loans, what grants they feel, we would definitely be entitled to.

469
00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:13.550
Don: What are they speculated for? That's coming down the road from Federal State local governments. and it's going to be distributed. So if I was making a proposal to you guys saying.

470
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:21.550
Don: we really want to do, Ev, this is how we can do it and try to. You know from the perspective that I've tried to with you on as a client.

471
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:24.980
Don: Yeah, I guess that's where that's the way I would go about doing it.

472
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:41.790
Joel Grayson: and if we could calculate that price differential for one bus, and talk about how you know every third bus or so could be electric. And then think about financing that I think that would be great for the for the next meeting to to have a price differential estimate.

473
00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:49.150
Don: Yeah, I think we said. I think we can again remember. Things will evolve. We think the economic equation is going to get better.

474
00:58:49.260 --> 00:59:00.110
Don: So again, it's not a question of. Is it doable? Yes, probably is what? When and like you said. But that's what I could lead with the with the manufacturer.

475
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:07.420
Joel Grayson: Alright, Thank you so much. I think we're good. Do you have? Any Anyways, we can help you Further.

476
00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:17.920
Don: I think I got it, you know. I mean, listen. Electronic vehicles or something we don't talk about every single day, but certainly it's it's topic that comes up quite a bit.

477
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:24.590
Don: You know we wanna we really want to do it. Not not. You know. We we don't want to do the superficial, you know.

478
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:30.320
Don: Dip the toll on the water like some of these municipalities have, or even like Logan has.

479
00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:36.620
Don: You know it's gonna be part of a long-term strategy right. You know. My plans are going to phase it in over time. Right?

480
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:44.830
Don: We will want, like you said, similar approach to right. Maybe every third vehicle now is Eb, that maybe every 2, every second vehicle.

481
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:54.600
Don: and then by 2,027 we can only buy. You'd be, anyway. So like I said it's it's inevitability. It's just a question of how fast we get there

482
00:59:56.870 --> 01:00:05.210
Dan Schultz: all right. Thank you. All

483
01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:09.880
Joel Grayson: all right.
